# `↑` higherhash `↑`

## Introduction

Multi-round prize pool nfts for the `↑higher↑` community !  Project inspired  by @yungwknd 

Mint fees are swapped for `$higher`. **mint fee is 0.001024 eth** for each nft

When an nft is minted, an unpredictable hash is generated by: `keccak256(block.timestamp, msg.sender, tokenId)`

The sum of the decimal values of the resulting `bytes32` hash is then mapped to the `tokenId` that was just minted. `keccak256` hashsums are normally distributed around `4080`. `hashsums` further away from `4080` have a lower probability of occurring. 

**There is a maximum supply of 128 NFTs**

When the 128th nft is minted:
  - the owner of the nft with **the highest hashsum wins** ALL the `$higher` in the prize pool `↑↑↑`
  - if two nfts both have the highest hashsum, the prize pool goes to the owner who minted first
  - all 128 nfts are burned
  - a new prize pool begins


The more nfts an owner owns, the higher the owner's chance of winning the prize pool in a given round
